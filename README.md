This is my following along with a tutorial from the [Ray Wenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com/201669-web-app-with-kotlin-js-getting-started) site.

# Running this

## Notes

This is primarily an example for a few people I know learning Kotlin. Some of the things done in the project are not the best choice but are done as an illustration of what _can_ be done.

I added a few `typealias`'s delineated by underscores (a non-typical naming convention) and a bunch of constants and extended functions that don't NEED to be there. It looks nicer though.
